# Regional Work Programme
Aims to capture European Nodes strategies and work programmes.

# Context
During the 11th European GBIF Nodes meeting, we looked back at previous Regional Work Programmes that were supposed to plan our collaborative efforts for the next 12 months. We have to admit that we rarely delivered what we were promising to do, but other collaborations emerged during the year. This is mostly due to funding opportunies, unexecpected collaborative works or simply emergeance of new ideas and needs to solve common problems. Therefore we agreed to try a new, more dynamic, approach: collaborations will be described and documented in a centralised way rather than in static annual documents. This Git repository is our first attempt to make such think.

# What can I find here?
European nodes [strategies](strategies/README.md) and [work programmes](workProgrammes/README.md) stored here are living documents written and organised by all European Nodes managers. All collaborative efforts within the European Nodes should theoretically be listed here.

* [ECA engagement strategy](https://github.com/GBIF-Europe/RegionalWorkProgramme/wiki/Outreach-strategy)
* [ECA research infrastructure strategy](https://github.com/GBIF-Europe/RegionalWorkProgramme/wiki/ECA-European-RI)
* [ECA communication strategy](https://github.com/GBIF-Europe/RegionalWorkProgramme/wiki/Communication-strategy)
* [ECA data publishing strategy](https://github.com/GBIF-Europe/RegionalWorkProgramme/wiki/Data-publishing)

# How can you particiate?
If your familiar with [Git Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/), simply contribute as you would do with any other repository.
If you are less familiar with it, just post your issues and let other elaborate them, or reply to others issues.

# Who can participate?
We mostly expect and welcome contributions from all European Nodes managers. Other potential contributors are European Nodes staff, GBIF Secretariat or GBIF community at large including data providers and data users.

# Effectiveness
The use and efficiency of this repository will be evaluated at our [European Nodes meetings](https://github.com/GBIF-Europe/Regional-ECA-meetings).
