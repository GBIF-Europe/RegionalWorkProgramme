# Engagement Strategy for Europe and Central Asia 2019-2021
This strategy, drafted by Tim Hirsch, emerged at the 11th European Nodes meeting in Oslo.
It focus on engagment of new GBIF participants in South East Europe and Central Asia and provides goals and sub-goals for 2019-2021.

## Headline goals

By the end of 2021, there will be:
1. 	Formal participation and an active GBIF node in every ‘EU+’ member state (EU27 + Iceland, Norway, Switzerland – and UK!)
2. 	A role for GBIF embedded in EU environmental reporting and research strategies
3. 	At least one participating country in each of:
  * South East Europe (non-EU states in former Yugoslavia, plus Albania)
  * Eastern Europe (Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova)
  * Southern Caucasus (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia)
  * Central Asia (Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan)
4. 	Formal participation from the Russian Federation and Turkey at least as Associate Participants
5. 	Data published from at least one institution in all European and Central Asian countries
6. 	A measurable reduction of data gaps in biodiversity in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (specific targets to be defined)


## Sub-goals

### 1. EU+ participation


  * 1a. Italy will be participating in GBIF at least as an associate participant, with an active national node.
  * 1b. Austria will be re-engaged as a GBIF participant (must be a voting participant as associate participation is no longer an option), with an active national node.
  * 1c. There will be active nodes in those EU+ participant countries where nodes are currently dormant or absent (Iceland, Slovenia, Slovak Republic)
  * 1d. All Baltic states will be participating in GBIF and have an active node (i.e. Latvia and Lithuania will have joined)
  * 1e. All central/east European countries in the EU will be participating in GBIF and have an active node (i.e. Croatia, Hungary, Czech Republic, Romania and Bulgaria will all have joined)
  * 1f. All Mediterranean countries will be participating in GBIF and have an active node (i.e. Greece, Malta and Cyprus will all have joined).
  * 1g. All EU+ nodes will a formal government-defined mandate, governance structure dedicated staff, a multi-annual budget and work plan (minimum score xx in section 1 of the national capacity self-assessment tool).

### 2. GBIF embedded in EU environmental reporting and research strategies

  * 2a. GBIF data publication and use will be embedded in reporting processes for EU directives related to biodiversity (possibly through an MoC with DG Environment)
  * 2b. The European Environment Agency will have an active GBIF node and a Memorandum of Cooperation with GBIFS with defined tasks and timelines
  * 2c. GBIF will have a clearly defined role embedded in EU research strategy and data management guidelines (possibly through MoC with DG Research and Innovation)
  * 2d. GBIF’s role in all existing and planned EU research infrastructures relating to biodiversity will be clearly defined through MoU or MoC

### 3. Participation in additional regions

  * 3a. South-East Europe. At least one among the following will be a GBIF participant with an active node: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo1, Montenegro, Northern Macedonia, Serbia
  * 3b. Eastern Europe. At least one among the following will be a GBIF participant with an active node: Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine
  * 3c. Southern Caucasus. At least one among the following will be a GBIF participant with an active node: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia
  * 3d. Central Asia. At least one among the following will be a GBIF participant with an active node: Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan
### 4. Russia and Turkey
  * 4a. The Russian Federation will be participating at least as an associate participant, with an active national node.

  * 4b. Turkey will be participating at least as an associate participant, with an active national node.

### 5. Comprehensive data publishing network

  * 5a. Every country in Europe and Central Asia will have at least one registered data publisher and a least one published dataset.
  * 5b. All non-participant countries in the region will have been involved in at least one funded project focussed on GBIF data mobilization and use.

### 6. Reduction of data gaps in Eastern Europe and Central Asia

  * 6a. Baseline metrics will be established to monitor data gaps in these regions and progress in filling them.
  * 6b. Gap-filling targets and strategies will be built into project calls and node work plans in these regions.
