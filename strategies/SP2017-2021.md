# GBIF 2017-2021 Strategic Plan
This [strategic plan](https://www.gbif.org/strategic-plan) focuses on five priorities.

# 1. Empower global network
Ensure that governments, researchers and users are equipped and supported to share, improve and use data through the GBIF network, regardless of geography, language or institutional affiliation.

* Remove barriers to participation
* Increase benefits associated with publishing biodiversity data
* Address capacity needs

# 2. Enhance biodiversity information infrastructure
Provide leadership, expertise and tools to support the integration of all biodiversity information as an interconnected digital knowledgebase.

* Coordinate vision and strengthen partnerships with major biodiversity informatics initiatives
* Promote standardization and common mechanisms for exchange of biodiversity data
* Provide stable and persistent data infrastructure to support research

# 3. Fill data gaps
Prioritize and promote mobilization of new data resources which combine with existing resources to maximize the coverage, completeness and resolution of GBIF data, particularly with respect to taxonomy, geography and time.

* Expand checklists to cover all taxonomic groups
* Identify and prioritize gaps in spatial and temporal data
* Engage institutions and researchers with complementary data

# 4. Improve data quality
Ensure that all data within the GBIF network are of the highest-possible quality and associated with clear indicators enabling users to assess their origin, relevance and usefulness for any application.

* Enhance automated data validation
* Implement tools for expert curation
* Provide clear quality indicators for all data

# 5. Deliver relevant data
Ensure that GBIF delivers data in the form and completeness required to meet the highest-priority needs of science and, through science, society.

* Engage with expert communities to manage data to the highest quality possible
* Deliver well-organized and validated data to support key applications
